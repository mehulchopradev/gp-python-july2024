class `list`
- to organize data in an ordered fashion one after another in continous memory locations
- supports duplicate data
- can be easily modified : add, remove, modify
- different operations can be easily performed on the list
- store homogenous data: marks, cars, Student --- preferred
- store heterogenous data: [name, gender, roll, marks] -- not preferred
- list is a mutable object

class `tuple`
- to organize data in an ordered fashion one after another in continous memory locations
- supports duplicate data
- unlike the list, the tuple data structure is immutable
- different operations can be easily performed on the list
- ideal data structure for storing heterogenous data: (name, gender, roll, marks) -- preferred
- store homogenous data: marks, cars, Student --- not preferred
